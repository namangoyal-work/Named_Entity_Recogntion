# Named Entity Recognition

The goal of this project is to build a NER system for Bio-medical text extracted from scientific documents/articles. The input of the code will be a set of tokenized sentences and the output 
will be a label for each token in the sentence. Labels will be from 4 categories i.e. Chemical_Compound, Biological_Molecule, Species and Others.
